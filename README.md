Steps-

1. **Header Files and Constants:**
   - The program starts by including necessary header files (`stdio.h` and `string.h`) for input/output and string manipulation functions.
   - `MAX_CONTACTS` is defined as the maximum number of contacts the program can store.

2. **Contact Structure:**
   - A `struct` named `Contact` is defined to hold information about a contact, including name, phone number, and address.

3. **Contact Array and Count:**
   - An array of `Contact` structures named `contacts` is declared to store the contact information.
   - An integer variable `contactCount` is used to keep track of the number of contacts currently stored.

4. **CRUD Functions:**
   - `createContact()`: Prompts the user to enter details for a new contact and adds it to the `contacts` array if there's space.
   - `readContacts()`: Displays the list of stored contacts (name, phone, and address) if there are any.
   - `updateContact()`: Allows the user to update the name and address of a contact based on the provided phone number.
   - `deleteContact()`: Allows the user to delete a contact based on the provided phone number.
   - `searchContact()`: Allows the user to search for a contact by entering a phone number and displays the contact details if found.

5. **Main Menu:**
   - The `main()` function runs an infinite loop to present a menu of options to the user.
   - Users can choose options (1-5) to perform corresponding operations on contacts or choose option 6 to exit the program.

6. **Switch Statement:**
   - The user's choice is determined using a `switch` statement that calls the appropriate function based on the selected option.
   - The default case handles invalid menu choices by displaying an error message.

7. **Loop and Exit:**
   - The program continues to display the menu and process user input until the user chooses to exit (option 6).

The program provides a basic text-based interface for managing contact information. Users can create new contacts, read existing contacts, update contact details, delete contacts, search for contacts by phone number, and exit the program. You can enhance this code further by adding error handling, validation, and additional features as needed.
